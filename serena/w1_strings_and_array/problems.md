## Strings: 

#### problem 1:  duplicates Characters a the given String

Given a string, write an algorithm to find all the duplicate characters in the string and print its count.

Input String: ingrid and serena learn go
```
Output: Duplicate Characters: 
i - 2
n - 4
g - 2
r – 3
d - 2
a - 3
e - 3
```

Follow-up : print the result in asc or desc order

#### problem 2:  Valid Multiple Parentheses

 Given a string containing just the characters ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘{‘, ‘}’, ‘[‘ and ‘]’, determine if the input string is valid.

Example:
```
()()([]({}))[] valid: true
()({]) valid: false
[]{}() valid: true
[(}{)] valid: false

```


#### problem 3:  Check if one string is Rotation of another string

Write an algorithm to check if one string is Rotation of another string.

Example:
```
Input Strings : 'sumitjain' and 'tjainsumi'
Output : true

Input String : 'Jaain' and 'ainJ'
Output: false
```


## Arrays: 

#### problem 1: find the largest element in array

Given an array of numbers, write a solution to find the largest element in the given array.

Example:
```
int [] a = {1, 5, 3, 9, 2, 8, 2}
Largest Element: 9

```

#### problem 2: Separate even and odd numbers in a given array

Given an array which contains even and odd numbers. Write an algorithm to separate even and odd numbers.

Example:
```
int [] arrA = {1,2,3,4,6,8,7,12};
Output: [12, 2, 8, 4, 6, 3, 7, 1]

```

#### problem 3: Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2

```

```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0

```
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4
```
